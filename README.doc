# WebsiteCreation README File


Welcome to The Creation Place! I am a Website developer on HTML and i will help you. This took me weeks to understand and now i have the hang of it. I will give you some information on HTML but to learn more on HTML go to https://www.w3schools.com/ That can give you codes on what to do. Let me tell you what HTML is really about:

                                                   __HTML__

1. It is for coding HTML / CSS / JS
2. HTML is a hard thing to learn
3. It is hard to learn
4. Website creations will not come with DOMAINS

                                                    __CSS__
                                                    
                                                    
Style is the style for the backround of your website. If you make a file called Style.css and put backround color and text and font it will put that inside the website.

                                                  __JS__
                                                  
                                                  
Javascript in HTML is hard. You need to look at https://www.w3schools.com/ for javascript stuff.
