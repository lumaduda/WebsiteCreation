When you make a website you wan't buttons that can lead you to places. Like a login button or buttons that take you to the discord server you created.

Write the following:

<a class="btn btn" href="Link goes here">Button text</a>

Put this inside the <head> tag.

If you want more buttons just copy and payste the code.
